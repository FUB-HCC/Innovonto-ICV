# Annotator Demo Project
Annotate entities in your knowledge graph.

This is still in active development and not usable.

## Usage
1. Upload your graph
2. Define where the un-annotated text comes from (via property)
3. Define if you only want to annotate a specific entity type (rdfs:type)
4. Define limit/offset
5. Annotate
6. Download the annotated version of your graph.
