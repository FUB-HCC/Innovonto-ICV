      "description": "ransparent conductive oxides are materials that can be used as thin coatings to make materials and surfaces intelligent. They are transparent, conductive and flexible. TCO coatings transform surfaces from objects and rooms into conductive and therefore interactive and touch-sensitive surfaces. Due to its transparency the original look and texture of surfaces is not changed."
